            Outdoors
            <br>I love feeling the sun on my face. Working in my yard, especially in my flower beds, it brings me a
            sense of calm and peace.
            During the summer, my children and I spend our free time in the pool, and exploring our local parks trails.
            On the weekends, I attend my childrens soccer games. Cheering them on and celebrating in their victories.
            I absolutely love the thrill of playing paintball, and played on a semi-professional team called "The
            Mouthy Mimes".

            Acts of Service
            <br>At least twice a year, my family and I bake goods for our local Fire Department & Police Station.
            We spend an entire day together trying new recipes for cookies, cakes, brownies, etc.
            The next day we deliver the goodies and thank them for their service to our community. We have done this for
            as long as my children can remember and we absolutely love it!

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <section class="background">
        <p>
            I grew up in Maryland, not too far from where I live now. My parents didn't discuss further eductation in my
            house which is why I am now starting school for development at 36 years young!
            I've made it a point to discuss school with my children and am proud to say my high school age children have
            straight A's and are looking into colleges to attend.
            I do not fault my parents, they did the best they knew how. My father is illiterate, but has managed to own
            three sucessful companies. He taught me from a very early age to work my butt off.
            He instilled an incredible work ethic in me, that I rarely see amongst my peers. I'm forever grateful for
            that.
